"Hey Muhammad,

You're facing one of the hardest job markets ever.

And with all the bad news and uncertainty, just know this: You're strong, and you'll make it through this.

Today, I want to show you how to find new job opportunities without applying or searching for companies yourself.

Here's the secret: Start with people who already want you to succeed.

Send this message today to everyone in your networkð
Â 
""Hi [name], I'm taking stock before Thanksgiving and wanted to reach out. I'm actively looking for [role] opportunities in [field]. If you know anyone hiring or would be open to a quick conversation, I'd really appreciate it.""
Â 
Change it to fit your true voice.

And when I say ""everyone"", I mean everyone.
Â 
Friends, family, past co-workers, etc. (just not your current boss if you have one ð)

DMs and texts work best. LinkedIn or email work too.
Â 
Hereâs why this works:
â You instantly multiply your reach.
â You remind people who already believe in you.
â You make it easy for them to help.
Â 
Even if no one has an opportunity today, youâll have dozens of people keeping an eye out for you.
Â 
If you want help turning that network into real (faster) offers, weâve got your back.
Â 
ð Work with us and we guarantee youâll get hired.
âï¸ 90% of our Ultimate Bundle clients land job offers within 120 days.
âï¸ The other 10% get a full refund, plus continued coaching until they do.
Â 
We have 12 spots left this month for our email audience.
Â 

ðÂ [Book your free strategy call â](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS)
Â 
Or call us now at (323) 425-4915.

Â 
Â 
Keep pushing through 2025.
Â 

You've got this!

The Job Market Just Shifted.
Here's Your Move.

Fall hiring season is here.

While everyone's talking about policy changes, smart job seekers are capitalizing on what companies actually need right now: qualified candidates who can start immediately.
Â 
[Book a free career consultation call](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS) to find out which companies are actively hiring for your background and how to position yourself as their obvious choice.

â

[Shadow]

What Changed in September

âï¸ Companies now pay $100k per new H-1B petition
âï¸ Legal challenges (the new fee might be overturned)
But hiring managers still need to bring in new people this fall.

The result? Market conditions shifted, creating specific advantages depending on your work authorization status.

Â 
Â 
If You're US-Authorized:
Your Three Moves This Week
Â 
You have a timing and cost advantage with certain companies. Here's where to focus:

Target growth-stage companies. Startups with Series A-C funding feel cost pressure most. Check Crunchbase for companies with 50-500 employees in SF, NYC, Seattle, Austin. These companies just became significantly more accessible to you.

Track companies adjusting strategy. Set up Google Alerts for target companies plus ""hiring."" Watch for job descriptions that dropped ""visa sponsorship available"" or added ""US work authorization required.""

Position for immediate impact. Emphasize your availability to start quickly. Companies value eliminating visa timing uncertainty for Q4 and early 2026 roles.

Â 
Â 
If You Need Sponsorship:
Where to Focus Your Applications
Â 
Donât give up if you need to apply for an H-1B. $100k spread out over 3 years is nothing for big tech, especially if you have an irreplaceable skill set. The key is targeting strategically.

Focus on large tech and consulting firms. The USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub shows exactly who sponsors at volume. Amazon approved 10,000+ petitions in 2024. Microsoft approved 9,000+. Google, Meta, Apple, Intel - all maintain large programs.

Â 
Target senior-level positions. Companies making larger investments favor experienced hires. If you have 3-5 years of experience, target roles at or slightly above your current level.

Build referral networks now. Connect with alumni at target companies. Request 15-minute informational interviews. In an uncertain market, referrals matter more than ever - they bypass initial screening and demonstrate existing connections.
Â 

[Shadow]

Here's What's Actually Working

You're spending the next few months job searching anyway. The question is whether you're guessing or following a proven system.

Most people send out 200 applications. Generic cover letters. Mass-applied resumes. Then they wait. And wait. Nothing happens.

There's a better way.

Our clients build resumes that actually get responses.Â 
LinkedIn profiles that make recruiters reach out.Â 
They target companies hiring people with their exact authorization status.Â 
They show up to interviews prepared to close offers.

The difference shows up fast.Â 

95% land interviews within 60 days. 90% get offers within 120 days.

Â 

Â 
The Guarantee

Complete our system over 120 days. Show up to coaching, apply our methods, and track your progress.

If you don't land at least one target job offer, we refund your entire investment - and keep coaching you until you do.

Either you land your next role, or you get your money back plus continued support.

Both outcomes move you forward.

Â 
Your Next Step
Â 
Fall hiring is already underway. The companies making offers in November and December are interviewing candidates right now.

Schedule your free career consultation and we'll show you:

- Which companies are best matches for your authorization status
- How to position yourself for fall hiring season
- The exact strategy that's working for candidates landing offers in 120 days

The market shifted. Your strategy should too.

[Schedule your free career consultation here](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS) and discover exactly what to do next.

September was packed with meaningful updates that make Visily faster, smarter, and more intuitive to use.

First up: our upgraded Screenshot Extension â now with even more control!
Youâve always been able to capture designs and turn them into editable mockups. This update makes the process even more flexible and precise:

* Full-page capture: Grab an entire screen in one click.
* Area selection: Highlight and capture just the parts you need.
* Component cropping: Snap specific UI elements like cards, buttons, or modals.
*
Viewport selection: Choose desktop, tablet, or mobile view before capturing.
This upgrade means less manual work and more accurate, ready-to-edit designs right inside Visily.

"Hey Muhammad,

If your job search has felt like pushing a boulder uphill, youâre not alone.
Iâve been there, and I see how much youâre trying.Â 
Â 
Letâs take a breath and make the next move count.
Â 
Hereâs the reality: itâs September 29. September and October are when teams finalize headcount and move fast. In November, budgets freeze. In December, people disappear into holiday mode. Thatâs why the next two weeks matter.
Â 
Here's your low-stress plan for the homestretch:
Â 
1ï¸â£ Make your LinkedIn headline do the selling (today).
Role | Core Skill | Outcome â e.g., âData Analyst | SQL & Tableau | Turn data â revenue.â Toggle âOpen to work.â Add 5 target titles.
Â 
2ï¸â£ Tighten your aim (3Ã/week).
Pick 1 role + 3 companies where your experience is a clean match and apply. No spray-and-pray.
Â 
3ï¸â£ Warm-intros (3Ã/week).
For each company, find 2 shared-context people (school, city, etc.). Ask for a 15-minute perspective chat, not a favor. Referrals often follow.

Â 
Â 
Now, something just for our email community:
Â 
Weâve opened our October cohort early and set aside 10 guaranteed spots for subscribers until Oct 1.

Join a free strategy call and weâll map a clear path to your offer in 120 days and confirm your fit for the program.
Â 
Â 
ð Secure your October spot now
[Book your strategy call â](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS)

Â 
Â 
â 90% of clients who complete our system land offers within 120 days.

â If youâre in the other 10%, you get a full refund - and we keep coaching you until youâre hired.
Â 
This means there's no risk for your investment ð

"Hey Muhammad,

I want to share something that could get you hired before the year ends - or position you for the first wave of hires in January.

This is especially important if you've been rejected by a company you really wanted to work for.

I know that gut-punch feeling when you see, ""We've decided to move forward with other candidates."" That's exactly why I'm sharing this with you.

This strategy can help you turn that rejection into an acceptance at the same company - sometimes in just a few months.Â 

Or at minimum, it can get you a referral from a senior leader to another company, which means you skip the 250+ applicant line in January.

The strategy? Show up where they can't ignore you - at their events.
Â 
Now before you say ""Jon, that's crazy""...
Â 
I've seen people get referrals from senior leaders they met at events - referrals that got them interviews at the same company that rejected them weeks earlier.
Â 

Here's why it works:

Recruiters filter resumes based on checkboxes and keywords. You might have been rejected for something completely fixable - not because you weren't qualified.

But if you meet senior leaders at events? They see you in a new light. Your communication skills, your passion, your cultural fit - all in real time.

When a director or hiring manager meets you in person and likes you, they can override earlier rejections. They can keep you top of mind, and they can refer you internally when new roles open.
Â 

Here's how to make it happen:

After getting rejected, don't just move on. Visit the company's website, LinkedIn, and social media to find upcoming events they're hosting or sponsoring.

Look for community outreach events, industry conferences, charity events, technical talks, or even trade shows.

Register as an attendee - not as a job seeker. Research who from the company will be there. Focus on decision-makers like VPs, directors, or department heads.
Â 
At the event, engage authentically. Have real conversations about industry challenges and innovations. Show your knowledge. Don't lead with ""I applied for a job here.""

If the conversation flows and the connection feels genuine, you can mention you recently applied. Frame it as admiration:

""I'm actually familiar with your company. I applied for a role recently because I'm passionate about the work you're doing in [specific area].""

That's how you show up where they can't ignore you.

Now here's the catch:
This only works if you're prepared. You need a strong resume, solid networking skills, and a guaranteed job search strategy.

That's exactly what my team and I help with at Wonsulting.

We're offering free career consultations where we'll identify what's holding you back and show you how to fix it.

Here's what happened last week: Our 10 consultation spots filled in under 48 hours.

So we opened 10 more spots this week.

If you're reading this before Tuesday, you still have a chance to grab one.

ð Book your free consultation here:Â âhttps://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS

The best January opportunities go to people who start preparing now - not in January when everyone else wakes up.
Â 
Â 
Talk soon,

Jonathan Javier
Co-Founder & CEO, Wonsulting

P.S. Companies host more events during the holidays, so start researching now.Â

( https://www.visily.ai/ )Hey there, ð

We just rolled out Visily 4.2âand itâs packed with updates designed to make your workflows faster, AI editing more reliable, and team collaboration smoother.

Thereâs a lot to love in this release. Letâs get into it â

Improved Browser Extension

When browsing sites with sample UI examples, simply hover over a UI template image to capture it instantly. It saves directly to your Visily account, and you can select only the images you want to importâleaving the clutter behind.

See the extension update â ( https://www.visily.ai/release-notes/release-note-v4-2-oct-2025/?utm_source=custio&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=release-note&utm_content=V4.2&utm_term=screenshot-extension-update#screenshot-extension-update )

AI fill for text componentsÂ 

Need placeholder text that's actually good? You can now ask the AI to fill in text for things like buttons, tables, and input fields based on the structure. You get smarter, useful content instantly, instead of random filler.

Try text fill â ( https://app.visily.ai/try/fill_content_with_ai?utm_source=custio&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=release-note&utm_content=V4.2&utm_term=ai-content-filler )

Interactive drop down

With the new interactive dropdown, you can create dropdowns that work in prototype mode, responding to clicks for a more realistic, high-fidelity experience in presentations and user tests.

Give it a try â ( https://app.visily.ai/try/interactive_dropdown?utm_source=custio&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=release-note&utm_content=V4.2&utm_term=interactive-dropdown )

Every Job Search Has 5 Stages

Imagine your job search as baking the perfect cake ð°

It seems complicated at first.
Ingredients everywhere, steps that could go wrong.Â 
Â 
But with the right recipe and persistence? You can create something amazing.
Â 
That's what we're giving you today: the complete recipe.Â 

The exact [5-stage system that's worked](https://app.wonsulting.ai/) for thousands of job seekers.
Â 
By the end of this email, you'll understand each stage and know how to identify where you are right now.

Plus, you'll discover the tool that creates your personalized roadmap once you're ready to begin.
Â 
[Get Your Personalized Job Search Plan â](https://app.wonsulting.ai/)

â

[Shadow]

Your Five Stages

Here's your complete roadmap:

Stage 1: Target Job
Pick one job title as your north star. Even if you'd be ""good at 20 jobs,"" hiring managers only care if you're perfect for theirs. Focus beats volume every time.

Stage 2: Resume
Build a target resume that matches your target job. Aim for a ResumAI score above 75. Every bullet point should scream ""I was born to do this exact job.""

Stage 3: Applying
Use your target resume to apply to at least 50 job openings with your exact target job title. Because it matches, your callback chances rise dramatically.

Stage 4: Interview
No interviews after 50 applications? That's useful data! Go back to stage 2 and revise your resume or target job. Getting interviews? Perfect your story, practice with InterviewAI, and prep for tough questions.

Stage 5: Offer
Master negotiation, compare packages, and close the deal. Keep momentum going until you land the role you want.

The secret? Knowing exactly which stage you're in right now.

Most people get lost in Stage 3, applying everywhere without tracking what works. Others never finish step 1.

"Hey Muhammad,

I know the H-1B lawsuit has been top of mind for many of you.

But here's the truth: We don't know what will change, and companies still need to hire.

The real problem? It's not the lawsuit.
Â 
It's that hiring managers are drowning in low-effort applications.
Â 
Think about it:

Other job seekers use AI tools to spam out hundreds of non-targeted resumes. Hiring teams can spot them instantly, but they can't stop the flood.

So they're doing what's reasonable: they're leaning toward referrals instead of job boards.

That's why the ""spray and pray"" method is dead.

If you want to stand out, you need a human strategy, not a copy-paste one.
Â 
That's exactly what we build with our clients:
Â 
â 90% of clients land offers within 120 days.
â The other 10% get a full refund + plus we keep coaching you until you're hired.
Â 
We take all the risk. You get all the results.
Â 
This week only, we opened 25 free strategy calls for email subscribers to identify what's holding you back, before the holiday hiring freeze hits.

"Dear Sir,
Assalamualaikum,
I hope youâre doing well.

This email is to share updates regarding our FYP Career Liaison Platform,
as we can't have a meeting this week.

- The backend MVC has been created, and API implementation is in progress.
- The AI models assigned to each team member are currently under
development.

We also have a query for your guidance:
During the student onboarding process, users are required to sign up via
Google using their institutional email so we can identify their respective
universities. However, this approach restricts users who are not enrolled
in any institution and therefore do not have an organizational email.

Should we continue focusing solely on university students, or should we
extend the platform to accommodate other users as well?
Your insights on this would be greatly appreciated.

The Message That Changes Everything

It's early December.

Â 
You're scrolling LinkedIn.

Â 
A message pops up from that director you connected with three weeks ago.

Â 
""Don't have an opening on my team, but I forwarded your profile to two VPs who do. Expect calls this week.""

Â 
That's the moment everything changes.

But here's what most job seekers miss: that December message gets sent because of the strategy you execute right now.

Â 
And that window is closing.Â

The Cold Outreach Graveyard

Most networking attempts fail for one reason.

They ask before they give.
They're generic ""pick your brain"" requests that create work for strangers.

But what if you could prove you belong in just 75 words?

The secret: show you've done your homework, ask one precise question, and make the next step easy.

The Framework That Gets Replies

Here's the structure (75â120 words max):
Pinpointed Opener: Reference their work specifically.
Micro-Credential: One line proving you're a peer, not a fan.
The Question: Ask about a trade-off they likely faced.
Don't ask for career advice. Ask how they made a hard decision.
The Binary Fork: Offer an easy alternative.
The Graceful Exit: Thank them for their work.

Here's what this looks like in practice:

""Hi Marcus, I just read your breakdown of Stripe's pricing migration in your Q3 retrospective. As a PM who's currently debating whether to grandfather legacy users or force migration, I'm curious: what was the constraint that made you choose the hard cutoff over a grace period? If it's easier, even pointing me to the right doc would be helpful. Thanks either way for putting your work out there.""

No resume attached.
No desperation.Â 
Just a sharp question from one professional to another!
Â 

[Shadow]

Your October Cadence

This isn't an ""Easy Apply"" economy ð
Â 
Job seekers who reach out and start conversations have the upper hand.

Here's your proven weekly system:

Monday: Identify three people you want to connect with.

TuesdayâThursday: Find one artifact for each person. A podcast, a blog post, a project they shipped.

WednesdayâFriday: Send one message each day using the framework above.

Track Everything: Replies, referrals, etc. This is how you turn one conversation into a chain of warm introductions.

This approach works, but most people waste weeks figuring out what actually gets responses.

Â 
Which is why we guarantee it.
Â 

We Guarantee Your Next Role

Land a job offer, or get your money back.

Here's why we can make this promise:
We've tracked results for three years. Job seekers who complete our proven [Ultimate Bundle](https://www.wonsulting.com/ultimate-bundle) system see extraordinary outcomes.

95% land interviews within 60 days.
90% land job offers within 120 days.
Â 

Here's How It Works

Â 
Complete our system. Show up to weekly coaching. Apply our proven strategies.
Â 
Our promise: If you complete everything and don't receive at least one job offer (from your target job) within 120 days, we refund 100% of your investment.

[ð Lock In Your Guaranteed Job Offer â](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS)

You either land your next role, or you get your money back plus coaching until you do.

Both outcomes beat scrolling job boards at midnight.

Either way, you win!

"Hey, Wade here.

 When teams get stuck with AI, it's rarely because they aren't working hard 
enough. It's usually friction, approval loops, unclear expectations, or no 
space to experiment.

 Speed happens when you unblock people. That's how we reached 89% AI adoption, 
by making it easier to try, test, and build.

 If you want space to think bigger about what's possible, ZapConnect's a good 
place to start. It's where folks across roles go to learn, share, and get 
hands-on with real workflows.

Check out ZapConnect  

 Sometimes you just need an hour to see what's possible.

 If you've been exploring Zapier but haven't built something yet, this is your 
nudge.

 We've got AI-powered templates built for specific rolesâmarketing, ops,

 Start here: Explore templates

"Hey Muhammad,

Career transitions are excitingâ¦ and letâs be honest, a little terrifying too.
Â 
One moment youâre fired up about pivoting from finance to tech.
Â 
The next? Youâre staring at job posts where everyone has 5+ years of experience you donât have.
Â 
And youâre thinking: âHow do I even stand out?â
Â 
We see this every week with the job-seekers we help.
Â 
Hereâs what most people donât realizeâ¦
Â 
November is secretly one of the BEST times to develop your skills for the job hunt ahead.
Â 
Companies are finalizing 2026 budgets right now. Theyâre forecasting. Hiring.
Â 
And theyâre looking for people who can connect dots others canât see.
Â 
Guess what? Thatâs YOU.
Â 
Your âall over the placeâ background isnât a weakness. Itâs your superpower. You bring perspective that career-lifers donât.Â 
Â 
But you need to harness that background into a singular specialized role.
Â 
Your finance lens in a tech role?
Your marketing brain in data?
Thatâs exactly what companies need but don't know how to hire for.
Â 
You just need to frame your transition as progression, not desperation.
Â 
Hereâs howð
Â 
â Marketing? Build a mini campaign for your dream company and post it.

â Data? Analyze a public dataset and tag them with insights.

â Product? Write a teardown showing what youâd improve.
Â 
âHereâs what Iâd doâ beats âIâm qualifiedâ every single time.

Start small. Take one action todayâ¦
Youâll be amazed what 30 days can do.

Youâve got this ðª
Â 
ð¯ Want to fast-track it?
Book a FREE consultation with our team.
Â 
Weâll help you frame your story so you become the easiest yes in the room.
Â 
We only have 5 consultations left this month. Don't wait.

"Hey, Wade here again. 

 A lot of people ask how we've driven such high AI adoption. I get it. New 
tech can feel like hype until it becomes a habit.

 For us, it's been about real examples over roadmaps. Show and tell. Leaders 
who aren't just talking about AI, but using it themselves. And sometimes, the 
little things spark the big shifts.

If you're leading a team or trying to get one on board, here are a few things 
to check out: 
 * My new podcast, Agents of Scale 

, where I have candid conversations with other C-suite leaders scaling AI 
across their organizations 
 * Brandon, our Chief People Officer, walks through how HR uses AI for 
onboarding and engagement  
 * Visit our Webinar Library  to get 
inspired for how to start building with AI 
 * A free IT guide on rolling out AI safely across your org 
, with guardrails 
that avoid the shadow tool mess  We're still figuring it out. But we're 
shipping faster and more confidently than we were a year ago. You can too.

 More soon,
 Wade 

 P.S. If RevOps is more your world, we've got a live AMA coming up with 
Lindsay, who leads our RevOps team. She'll share how they've built 25+ AI 
workflows and scaled usage across the org.Save your spot here 
 if that's helpful.

Your application answers
five questions you never see.

Â 
Miss one, you're eliminated ð

Every hiring decision comes down to these unspoken questions.Â 

But here's the problem: They're never asked directly.
Â 
Â 
The Five Hidden Questions

While you're polishing your experience section, hiring managers are evaluating something biggerð
Â 

#1: Can you do the work?
Skills, experience, certifications. This is foundational, so letâs go deeper.

#2: Will you do it well?Â 
One typo predicts careless project delivery. Inconsistent formatting suggests poor attention to detail. They're judging your future performance by your current application quality.

#3: Do you actually want THIS job?
Generic cover letters scream ""mass application."" Did you research their recent product launch? Mention specific challenges they're facing? Or did you send the same letter to 47 companies?

#4: Can we actually hire you?
Work authorization, clean background, etc. Basic requirements you need to verify yourself.

#5: Will you accept our offer?
Overqualified candidates get rejected constantly. Not because they can't do the work, but because managers assume they'll leave for something better.
Â 
So how do you get the answers right?

Â 

[Shadow]

Why Question #3 Eliminates Otherwise Strong Candidates

Picture this scenario:

Two equally skilled applicants apply for the same role.
Â 
Candidate A researched the company, referenced their values, mentioned their recent acquisition.
Â 
Candidate B has slightly better experience, but their resume highlights their achievements in ""B2C mobile app growth,"" while this role is for a B2B enterprise software team.
Â 
Itâs a great resumeâ¦ for a different job.

Who feels safer to the hiring manager?

Understand that they're not just hiring skills. They want someone who won't cause problems, won't leave in three months, and won't need constant hand-holding.

They want the ""safe yes.""

Generic applications communicate the opposite. They suggest you don't care enough to research. That you're shopping around. That this is just another number in your application spreadsheet.
Â 
This means getting hired isn't about being the most qualified.

It's about being the easiest decision.

How WonsultingAI Helps

Â 
In 2025, companies are getting 182% more job applications compared to 2021.Â¹
Â 
Use WonsultingAI to help your application answer the unspoken questions that get you hired.
Â 
Itâs the same structured approach thatâs helped thousands of underdogs land offers from Google, Deloitte, and other dream companies.
Â 
Â 
Questions 1 & 2: Can you do the work? Will you do it well?
Â 
[ResumAI](https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes) answers this by transforming your duties into measurable accomplishments recruiters want to see.
Â 
Instead of ""Managed social media,"" you get ""Increased engagement 47%..., generating 2,300 qualified leads in Q4.""
Â 
Our professional templates eliminate careless formatting errors, signaling youâre a candidate with high attention to detail.
Â 
Â 
Question 3: Do you want THIS job?

Use [CoverLetterAI](https://app.wonsulting.ai/cover-letters) to create personalized letters that reference specific company details. Automate the tedious part of tailoring applications, and show you did your research and arenât just sending the same doc everywhere.
Â 

Questions 4 & 5: Can we hire you? Will you accept our offer?

These are about strategy. By handling the heavy lifting of writing, our AI suite frees you up to focus on what matters:
Â 
verifying requirements and positioning yourself as the perfect fit - qualified, but not so senior theyâll think youâll leave in six months.
Â 
Â 
The Real Problem Isn't You

You have the skills companies need.

The problem is that theyâre drowning in applications.

The candidates landing interviews aren't just applying everywhere; they're crafting targeted applications that speak directly to each company's needs.

WonsultingAI lets you do this for every important role without the burnout.

Stop guessing what recruiters want to see.

"Hey Muhammad,

I know you might be thinking:
Â 
""It's November. I'll just wait until January to really kick my job search into gear.""
Â 
I felt that way in the past, too.
Â 
But here's why that's a big mistake:Â 
The offers people celebrate in January were built in November.
Â 
Let me explain.
Â 
In a few months, everyone will flood LinkedIn.Â Recruiters' inboxes will explode.Â Competition will triple overnight.
Â 
And you'll be competing with hundreds of people for the same roles.
Â 
But right now? It's quiet. Which is exactly the advantage you need.
Â 
Here's why starting now changes everything:
Â 
November gives you time to fix what's broken before the chaos hits.
Â 
You can update your resume without pressure. Test your LinkedIn profile. Practice your interview answers. Figure out what's actually holding you back.
Â 
Then when January hits and everyone else is scrambling? You're already ahead.
Â 
Here's a quick gut check:

- If you've sent 50+ applications with zero interviews - your resume needs work.
- If recruiters aren't reaching out on LinkedIn - your profile needs an update.
- If you're getting interviews but no offers - your interview skills need practice.

November is your chance to fix it all.
Â 
And honestly? That's your best shot at landing an offer while 400+ people are still figuring out their New Year's resolutions ð
Â 
Want help making it happen?
Â 
I've been in your shoes, and I know how hard it is to figure this out alone.
Â 
That's why we're keeping our 120-Day Wonsulting Guarantee open - andÂ we're reserving our first 10 November spots for our email audience.
Â 
Here's how it works:
Â 
We give you the coaching, tools, and strategies that have helped 90% of our clients land offers within 120 days.
Â 
Your part: Show up and complete our system.
Â 
Our promise: If you don't land an offer within 120 days, we refund 100% of your investment. And we'll keep coaching you until you do.
Â 
Because your problem shouldn't be getting noticed.
Â 
Your problem should be choosing between multiple offers.
Â 
ð Ready to start? Book your free career consultation here:
âhttps://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS

Â 
Â 
You got this,
Â 
Jonathan Javier
Co-Founder and CEO, Wonsulting
Â 
P.S. Our Monday and Tuesday calendar is already full, but we have spots right now from Wednesday - Friday.

"Hey Muhammad,
Â 
Jerryâ¦Â 
I've been applying for four months and only got two interviews.Â 
What am I doing wrong?

Â 
That text came from my friend Tiff last month. Despite having Google and Zendesk on her resume, her job search had completely stalled.

Tiff and I met back in 2018 when our teams collaborated at Google, and we've stayed close ever since.

https://app.wonsulting.ai/community?resume=c725a8b7-7676-4ee1-b796-9dc18b9fe410

Us at Google, 2018

Â 
So when she told me she needed help getting interviews, I had to step in. Not as ""Jerry the co-founder,"" but like our coaching team would for any client.

We treated her search like a project.

Here's what we did differently:

â Define: We picked one target role she'd be excited about and competitive for.
â Package: We rebuilt her resume to the role's success criteria and synced LinkedIn to match.
â Launch: We shipped a tight, 50-company application sprint with high-fit companies only.

Two weeks later? She's gotten 8+ interviews (â16% interview rate).

Â 
And she's now in final rounds at multiple companies.

When I think about it, Tiffâs biggest hurdle was mindset.Â 

She had been undervaluing her seniority and market value. Our work surfaced wins she had been downplaying and put them front and center.Â 
Â 
I've been there myself.
Â 
When I was job searching, I wish I had someone to help coach me.Â 

I wish I had someone help me realize that I'd been underselling myself and targeting the wrong roles.

Sometimes you need that second pair of eyes to see your blind spots.

If your search feels stuck too, remember this framework:

â Define one specific role (and its success metrics)
â Package your achievements to mirror those metrics (resume + LinkedIn)
â Launch a short, intense, high-fit sprint

That's what we do at Wonsulting: define your target, rebuild your narrative, and execute a strategy that creates interviews - fast.

And now, we guarantee job offers in 120 days with our Ultimate Bundle:
Â 
Land a job offer in 120 days (like 90% of our clients) or get a full refund and continued coaching until youâre hired.

[â Get your guaranteed job offer in 120 days](https://www.wonsulting.com/ultimate-bundle)

We'll help you see what you can't see, position your wins properly, and build momentum in your search. Just like we did for Tiff.
Â 
Â 
Talk soon,
Â 
Jerry
Â 
P.S. We have a big update coming out soon for WonsultingAI, so be on the lookout for an announcement from us.

*NOTICE*

Dear Students,

We hope this announcement finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to
ensure a safe, organized, and conducive environment for everyone on campus,
we would like to take a moment to inform you about our policy regarding
night stays.



*Campus Facilities and Operating Hours*

Our campus operates on a schedule, time work designed to provide an optimal
environment for learning, teaching, and working during regular working
hours of university. While we strive to offer a wide range of facilities
and services to support your academic and professional pursuits.

*No Facility of Night Stay, accommodation and food*

We regret to inform you with great concern that our campus has no facility
of night stay, food or accommodation for stay for the officials, visitors,
and students. The university has no responsibility to provide any such
services according to university rules. Specifically, we do not have any
hostel accommodations available for students or visitors, and no food
services are available after official campus hours, therefore you are
informed not to demand any such facility from the university.



*Planning Your Visit or Stay*

In light of this, we kindly request that all employees and students plan
their schedules and arrangements accordingly. If you are in the campus for
academic or professional purposes, we encourage you to make necessary
arrangements for your stay and meals outside of campus.



We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to this
policy. Your compliance will help us maintain a safe, secure, and organized
environment for everyone.

The 3x Multiplier Changing Everything

Â 
By now you know.
Â 
The career landscape didn't just flip.
Â 
It's been doing 360 somersaults for months ð
Â 
And while job boards scream doom-and-gloom, here's what the headlines miss:
Â 
In 2025, AI-forward companies are generating 3x more revenue per employee than their competitors.Â¹
Â 
And they're not just cutting costs.
They're payingÂ premium salariesÂ for people who get it.
Â 
Which means this isn't about surviving.
Â 
It's about positioning yourself as the one they can't afford to replace...
Â 

[Shadow]

The 3x Revenue Reality

When a company triples revenue per employee, they don't need more people.
Â 
They need the right people.

Deloitte's data shows these top-AI companies are achieving up to 50% productivity gains.Â² And they're maintaining lean teams while generating exponential value.

This creates an interesting dynamic.

These companies can afford to pay significantly more for each position.
One financial analyst who can orchestrate AI effectively replaces what used to require an entire team.

That analyst becomes incredibly valuable.

We're seeing salary premiums of 40% or higher for professionals who demonstrate AI orchestration capabilities.Â³

But here's what separates the winners from everyone else...

The Orchestration Advantage
Companies aren't looking for more AI users.

They're competing for AI orchestrators.

ð Basic users achieve 2x productivityâ´
ð¤ Skilled orchestrators deliver up to 10x productivityâµ
Strategic multipliers create entirely new revenue streams
Â 
The difference? Orchestrators don't just use AI tools.
They coordinate multiple AI agents, optimize workflows, and identify opportunities others miss.

In healthcare technology? These roles are experiencing double-digit growth.
In AI-enhanced manufacturing? Development cycles are up to 60% faster.
In sustainable finance? Professionals with both domains command significant premiums.

But technical skills alone won't get you there...

The Trust Differentiator
Speed without judgment equals risk.

As AI capabilities expand, companies need professionals who ensure responsible deployment.

These aren't the people building AI. They're the ones ensuring AI creates sustainable value.

They understand that one biased algorithm or security breach could destroy competitive advantage overnight.

This combinationâAI orchestration plus risk awarenessâis what commands top compensation.

Â

Your Strategic Position

Domain Expertise + AI Orchestration + Risk Management = Premium Value
Â 
Here's your tactical approach:
Â 
Week 1: Identify companies announcing AI productivity improvements.
These organizations have budget for top talent.
Â 
Week 2: Develop your orchestration story.
How does AI enhance your specific expertise?
Â 
Week 3: Daily 15-minute investments:

- Monday: Research one AI tool in your field
- Tuesday: Map it to existing workflows
- Wednesday: Document measurable productivity gains
- Thursday: Share insights on LinkedIn
- Friday: Connect with professionals at AI-forward companiesÂ 
The Quality Question
In conversations, focus on value creation:
Â 
""How do you measure AI's impact on productivity?""
""What's your approach to AI quality control?""
Â 
These questions position you as someone who understands both opportunity and responsibility.
Â 
The Bottom Line
The 3x revenue revolution isn't just creating more jobs.
It's creating more valuable jobs.Â²
Â 
Companies achieving these productivity gains are selective. They're looking for professionals who can multiply impact while managing complexity.
Â 
The question isn't whether AI will replace you.
Â 
The question is: Will you position yourself among the professionals these companies compete to hire?
Â 
Your next move determines whether you're competing with hundreds of traditional applicants... or positioning yourself for the premium roles that define the new economy.
Â 
The math is clear.
Â 
Make it work for you!

"WONSULTING WEEKLY NEWSLETTER
You'll love this.

While everyone's panicking about AI stealing their jobs, a small group of professionals just landed 40% salary increases.

Here's what they know that others don't:

AI isn't replacing jobs.
Â 
It's creating premium, higher-paying versions of existing roles.

PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer confirms it:Â 

Wages are rising twice as fast in AI-exposed industries, with AI-skilled workers earning premium salaries across every sector they analyzed.

But here's the twist most people miss...
Â 
Most people assume you need to become an AI engineer or programmer to benefit from the AI boom.

Not true.

The biggest opportunities are going to professionals who become AI-enhanced versions of what they already are.

Think about it: Companies don't just need AI builders.
Â 
They need AI users who understand business context, customer needs, and industry nuances.

That's where the real money is.

And it's happening in three distinct categories...

WONSULTING WISDOM

3 AI-Skills Categories Worth Premium Pay

These opportunities fall into three distinct skill categories that are already reshaping the job marketð
Â 
1. Hybrid AI Integration
This is your fastest path to a raise.

- Data analysts are using AI for pattern recognition and automated reporting
- Marketing professionals leverage AI for campaign optimization
They didn't abandon their expertise.
They amplified it.

The result? Skill requirements in AI-exposed roles are evolving 66% faster than last year.

This leads to urgent demand for professionals who can bridge AI capabilities with domainÂ knowledge.
Â 

2. Human-AI Collaboration Mastery
Here's what companies discovered: AI can process data brilliantly, but it can't understand company culture or make nuanced decisions that consider stakeholder relationships.

This is why creativity, communication, and leadership have become premium skills in AI-heavy roles.

The professionals commanding top salaries aren't just AI users.

They're AI directors who use real experience and professional judgment to guide AI capabilities toward business outcomes.
Â 

3. Agentic AI Application
The cutting edge for 2025: professionals building AI systems that autonomously handle complex workflows with minimal human oversight.

This builds directly on the first two categories.
Â 
You need domain expertise to design the workflows, plus human judgment to ensure valuable outcomes.

But how do you actually position yourself for these opportunities?

LEVEL UP!

Your AI Career Action Plan

ð Path 1: Job Seekers - Start With Immediate Wins Â 
Don't begin with complex AI theory.
Â 
Start with accessible tools to build demonstrable skills:

- Automate document creation using AI templates
- Create data visualizations with AI assistance
- Build sample AI reports for your target industry
Practice these skills on personal projects or volunteer work.
Â 
When you walk into an interview describing how you used ChatGPT to create a comprehensive market analysis that would typically take 4 hours in just 30 minutes, you're not discussing theory.
Â 
You're demonstrating immediate value.
Â 
How to target AI opportunities:
Â 
Â â LinkedIn searches: ""AI implementation,"" ""prompt engineer,"" ""AI strategy,"" ""generative AI consultant""
Â 
Â â Company career pages: Search ""artificial intelligence"" or ""machine learning"" in job descriptions
Â 
Â â AngelList or Y Combinator: Filter for AI/ML startups in growth stage
Â 
Â âÂ Industry reports: Check which companies mentioned AI investments in recent quarterly earnings

Â 

ðÂ Path 2: Current Employees - Lead the Integration

Every department in your company will eventually integrate AI.Â 

And the person leading that integration will become indispensable.

â Volunteer to pilot AI tools in your department. Success positions you as the obvious choice when AI-related promotions open.

Â âÂ Document everything. Build a track record like: ""I implemented an AI-assisted customer service workflow that reduced response time by 60% and increased customer satisfaction scores by 23%.""

That's the specific, measurable impact that gets you promoted.
Â 
Remember:
The job market is always changing, and right now, developing AI skills is one of the best ways to land a job in tech.

The professionals thriving in 2025 aren't avoiding it. They're adopting it.

They understand that AI doesn't replace domain expertise.

It amplifies it exponentially.

And that amplification creates those better, higher-paying versions of the jobs you already want.

How to Spot Ghost Jobs in 60 Seconds (Or Less)

Here's something scary.
Â 
Between 10% and 43% of job postings on the internet right now aren't real.Â¹
Â 
They're ghost jobs ð»
Â 
Companies use ghost jobs to collect data, do market research, and make HR look busy.
Â 
As a result, you spend 30 minutes crafting the perfect resume and writing a thoughtful cover letter for an imaginary job opening.
Â 
This happensÂ a lot.
Â 
So today, we're showing you how to spot ghost job openings and avoid them where possible.
Â 
If you're tired of endless applications that go nowhere:

The 60-Second Ghost Test

If it takes just a few minutes to apply to a job, it might not be worth it to check if it's real or not.
Â 
But for lengthy applications, it makes sense to invest a few minutes up front to make sure you're not wasting your time.
Â 
So before you apply, run this check.
Â 
â When was it posted?
Anything older than three weeks can be suspicious. Fresh posts, especially ones showing application counts or recent updates, prove something's actually moving.

Â 
â Stale listings that never change?
Skip them.Â They're corpses. Dead jobs just sitting there, collecting digital dust and your precious time.

Â 
â Can you see concrete details?
Real jobs have specifics. Hiring timeline. Interview process. Named recruiter. Salary range. Required location. Actual responsibilities you can picture yourself doing.

Â 
Ghost jobs hide behind vagueness like a ""competitive salary"" with no range.
Endless requirements describing a unicorn, not a human they actually want to hire.
Â

Your New Survival Strategy

Think triage, not spray-and-pray.

Phase One: Quick Filter (60 seconds)

Three questions âï¸Â 
âï¸ Posted just once recently?
âï¸ Posted within three weeks?Â 
âï¸ Has specific details and salary info?

Â 
Fail two of these? Move on. Don't look back.

Â 
Â 
Phase Two: Verification (5-10 minutes)

Â 
âï¸ Search for duplicates.
Google the exact job title plus company name. If you find the same listing reposted monthly for six months, you've discovered a perma-post.

Â 
âï¸Â Check LinkedIn for recent hires.
âï¸Â Google for repost history.

Still unsure? Send a short message: ""Hi [recruiter name], I'm interested in the [role]. Is this position actively being filled?""

Â 
Â 
Phase Three: Deep Application (30-90 minutes)
Â 
Only now do you invest time in tailored resumes and cover letters, plus take-home assignments.Â Because now you've verified this job actually exists.

Â 
Why This Matters
Your time is finite, and so is your energy.Â 

The average job seeker spends 11 hours per week applying to jobs. If 30% of those go to ghost jobs, you're wasting over three hours weekly on positions that were never real.

That's 12+ hours per month.

Â 
Nearly 150 hours per year, gone.

Â 
Let us save you the time.Â 
Book your free consultation here and let's find you a real job.
Â 

[Learn about our 120-day guarantee â](https://www.wonsulting.com/ultimate-bundle)

Imagine what you could do with that time instead. More targeted networking. Better interview prep. Actually talking to humans who can hire you.

Â 
Ghost jobs exist because companies face no penalty for posting them.
You can't change that.

Â 
But you can stop being the person who applies to them.
Use the 60-second filter. Invest five minutes in verification. Save the heavy lifting for opportunities that are actually real.

Â 
Because the fastest way to land a job isn't applying to more positions.

Â 
It's applying to the right ones.

Â 
The ones that aren't haunted ð»

Roadmap + AI Overview Video

Weâre living in exciting times at roadmap.sh. Over the last months, weâve been working hard to integrate AI into the project. Itâs been a lot of effort (also, a lot of fun), and, while thereâs still a big room for improvement, weâre happy the say that our new AI tutor is already live and helping users around the world in their learning goals.

The possibilities of AI are endless, and we want to make sure you leverage the full potential of the AI Tutor. Thatâs why we recently launched a live session (https://updates.roadmap.sh/e3t/Ctc/L2+113/d5qLSh04/VVK37L4LHxDmW38ZrSG81JwSVW2z6fd_5DTKGjN3_3-J83prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3nSW2qfJL12-jXzhW8kr0BD5qGVgdW3pcQpF6RY5CrW66G1b_6kjynrW3GQpmY21BvF-VZQJLQ74cssFW87nVHs4qsr2yN1bhXH55b-gSW6yRsJ62_p-_RVPp2-37Vrjp9W3zktSb2QDGnLW7tN0x030VWTwW8n_xj_844hr-N61L5GLv1XDDW7Qs48v34FZwWW4W1Kwq8b9j4xW3qZvNK3shbzxW6MSjyB36sMVpW3kN3Ym7mWVwcW1HXX2y6H3xGqW9lrZRx3TqjYLMpVBTyz3vxqMc9DcsmfZRDN78dBRfZKr87W7cq0Q-5RPvJdW9gnvqZ1jxh3Ff3N2V3F04 ) where Kamran Ahmed, the founder of roadmap.sh, presented the story of the AI tutor and all its unique features to enhance personalized learning.

"You've got 37 tabs open, each with a different job posting.

Your resume is staring back at you like ""again, really?"" as you try to customize it for the 15th time today.

CAREER STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS

Julyâs job search forecast is in! âï¸

Overall demand has cooled from pandemic highs,
niche expertise is getting first call-backs,
and entry-level roles remain tight while AI, cyber, and cloud roles stay hot.
Â 
Thatâs why weâre helping your inner specialist shine!
Â 
So this week:
Â 

ð¤ Grab three mid-year tactics to land more interviews
ð Float to the top of LinkedIn search results
ð Unlock our most powerful WonsultingAI feature yet

Â 
Letâs dive right in!

Â 
Tip #1: Master the Art of Resume Tailoring
Â 
Tailoring your resume is crucial, but it's also time-intensive. Here's what it typically involves:

- Analyze the job description
- Identify key skills and requirements
- Rewrite your experience to match the requirements

This process can take 30-60 minutes per application.Â 
Â 
Multiply that by dozens of job applications, and you're looking at hours of tedious work.
Â 
But thatâs why we made JobBoardAI!
Â 
It automates this entire process and gives you tailored resumes (and cover letters) in minutes, not hours.Â 
Â 
The best part? It's completely free for job seekers!
(hiring teams are fronting the bill)

[Tailor your resumes at no cost](https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes)

Tip #2: Max-Out Your LinkedIn Profile
Â 
With recruiters actively scouring LinkedIn for top candidates, nowâs the time to make your profile shine.
Â 
Hereâs how to do it:

- Update Your Headline: Craft a compelling headline that highlights your expertise and includes key industry terms. Use [Wonsulting Wendy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wonsulting-wendy/) as a guide!
- Write a Magnetic Summary: Tell your professional story and showcase what makes you unique.
- Highlight Achievements: Under each role, focus on accomplishments and quantify your impact where possible.
- Engage with the Community: Like, comment, and share industry-related content to increase your visibility.
- Gather Endorsements and Recommendations: They boost your credibility and show social proof of your skills.

Remember, a standout LinkedIn profile can attract opportunities you didnât even know existed!
Â 
Tip #3: Use the 3x3 Networking Strategy
Â 
If youâve been slacking on your network, now is the time to step it up!Â 
Â 
While other job seekers are on summer break, set a goal to:

- Make 3 new connections (daily)
- Contact 3 current connections (daily)

And you can message new connections with LinkedIn Premium for $30/monthâ¦
Â 
Or you can use this free [cold emailing feature](https://app.wonsulting.ai/networking-tool) to uncover the hidden emails of top executives, hiring managers, and recruiters at your target companies! ð

https://app.wonsulting.ai/networking-tool

By consistently making new connections, you increase your chances of meeting someone who knows about unadvertised job openings or can refer you directly to a hiring manager!
Â 
We know these 3 tips will help you land more interviews this summer!Â 
Â 
Just make sure to put in the work ð

Wonsulting Wisdom

ð¤« Secret Recruiter Tip: Optimize Your Online Presence for LinkedIn Searches

Ever wondered how recruiters find top talent like you?Â 
Â 
It's time to let you in on a little secret: Boolean search! ðµï¸ââï¸
Â 
Think of it as a laser-focused Google search.
Â 
Here's a sneak peek at how recruiters might use it to search for a software engineer:
Â 
(""software engineer"" OR ""full stack developer"") AND (Python OR JavaScript) AND ""machine learning""
Â 
Cool right?
Â 
Now, let's make sure YOU pop up in these searches! ð

5 Tricks to Show Up in LinkedIn Search
Â 
Letâs say youâre targeting a UX Designer role. These tips work for any role, but weâll go with UX Designer for reference:
Â 
1/ Diversify Your Job Titles
Instead of just ""UX Designer,"" try:
""UX Designer | User Experience Specialist | Interaction Designer""
Â 
Why? This covers more search variations recruiters might use.
Â 
2/ Get Specific with Skills
Don't just say ""design skills."" Spell it out:
""Wireframing, Prototyping, User Testing, Information Architecture, Usability Analysis""
Â 
Why? This matches exact terms recruiters search for.
Â 
3/ Speak the Industry Lingo
Sprinkle your profile with relevant keywords like:
""User-Centered Design, Design Thinking, A/B Testing, Persona Creation""
Â 
Why? This shows you're up-to-date with industry trends.
Â 
4/ Showcase Your Tech Stack
Flaunt your tool expertise:
""Proficient in Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, InVision, UsabilityHub, Hotjar""
Â 
Why? Many searches include specific tool requirements.
Â 
5/ Certifications? Use the FULL Names
""Google UX Design Professional Certificate"" sounds way more impressive than just ""UX certified""
Â 
Why? It matches exact certification names recruiters might search.
Â 
And donât forget to post regularly about industry trends, your projects, or industry insights. The LinkedIn algorithm loves active users and boosts them in search results! ð
Â 
Remember, strategically placing these terms throughout your profile is like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for recruiters to find YOU.Â 
Â 
So get optimizing, and watch those interview requests roll in! ðª

Become the AI-Ready Hire They Need Now

We've got good news this July ð
Â 
While only 40% of companies are hiring overall, 51% of tech companies are actively recruiting right now.Â¹
Â 
But here's what most people don't know...

Companies investing in AI report the strongest hiring plans this quarter.Â²
Â 
Which means if you can position yourself as AI-ready, you're not competing for jobs anymore.

You're becoming the candidate recruiters hunt for.
Â 
Here's how to get there:

Â 
This week's AI-ready toolkit
ð Resume transformation that screams ""AI-savvy"" (even if you're a beginner)
ð 3 AI upskilling moves that take 30 minutes to start

But first, let us show you something that might surprise you...

WONSULTING WISDOM

How to Add AI Skills to Your Resume

You're underselling yourself.

Most job seekers think AI skills require a computer science degree.
Â 
But if you've ever uploaded a spreadsheet to ChatGPT for analysis, you've just demonstrated practical AI application that 90% of managers can't do.

The problem isn't your skills. It's how you're describing them.

Here's the formula that gets interviews:

Step 1: Lead with the Human Spark
""Engineered custom ChatGPT prompts..."" or ""Built AI-powered workflow...""
Start with action, not acronyms.

Step 2: Name the Technique (Briefly)
This depends on your level:

- Beginner: ""...using AI document analysis...""
- Intermediate: ""...leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation...""
- Advanced: ""...implementing custom vector search...""

Step 3: Drop the Business Impact
""...reducing report generation from 2 hours to 6 minutes.""

Always end with numbers that make CFOs smile!

Here's What This Looks Like:
Â 
Starter: ""Automated competitive analysis using ChatGPT document uploads, reducing research time from 4 hours to 30 minutes per client brief.""
Â 
Intermediate: ""Developed RAG-powered ChatGPT system integrating company documentation to automate client research, cutting preparation time from 3 hours to 15 minutes per discovery call.""
Â 
Advanced: ""Built custom vector database with OpenAI embeddings for real-time policy retrieval, enabling instant compliance answers and reducing legal review cycles by 60%.""

Why This Works: You're showing technical fluency without technical intimidation. Recruiters see someone who can bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and real business results.

Your Move: Pick your level and find one project where you used AI to solve a problem. Even if it was just summarizing meeting notes with Claude or analyzing survey data with ChatGPT.

Rewrite it using this formula. Post it on LinkedIn.

Because here's the reality: companies desperately need people who can make AI practical, not theoretical.

Your AI experiments are more valuable than you think!

LEVEL UP!

Three 30-Minute AI Wins That Land Interviews

Your competition just got smaller.

While others debate whether AI will replace them, smart job seekers are building AI skills that make them irreplaceable.Â 
Â 
Here's how to gain a meaningful advantage, often in as little as 30 minutes a day.

Sprint 1: Build Your Prompt Library (5 days)
Day 1: Copy 3 job descriptions into Claude.
Ask: ""What are the 5 most common tasks in these roles?""
Get specific examples.
Days 2-4: Create prompts like: ""Analyze this sales data and identify the top 3 actionable insights with supporting metrics."" Test on real examples.
Day 5: Ask Claude: ""How can I improve these prompts for better results?""
What you'll have: A reusable system that turns AI into your personal assistant.

Sprint 2: AI-Powered Portfolio Project (7 days)
Days 1-2: Ask Claude: ""Find me 3 datasets relevant to [your industry] with clear business problems to solve.""
Days 3-5: Upload data and prompt: ""Walk me through analyzing this step-by-step. What insights should I highlight?""
Days 6-7: Ask: ""How should I present this to show both AI collaboration and critical thinking?""
The result: Portfolio proof that you don't just use AI. You interpret results and drive decisions.

Sprint 3: Build Your First Automation (4+ days)
Day 1: Tell Claude: ""I spend too much time on [specific task]. How can I automate this with Zapier?""
Days 2-3: Follow AI's step-by-step tutorial. Ask for troubleshooting help.
Day 4: Prompt: ""Help me calculate ROI and document this for my resume.""
Your outcome: A real automation plus a measurable resume bullet.

Pro-Tip: Stuck anywhere? Screenshots are your friend. Instead of typing what's wrong, share a screenshot and ask: ""What am I missing?"" or ""What would an expert do differently?""

This works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini or any advanced AI.
Â 
But it only works if you start today â°

"WONSULTING WEEKLY NEWSLETTER

Your Experience is Relevant!

Here's what nobody tells you about ""relevant experience"":

The candidates getting hired aren't the ones with the most obvious qualifications.

They're the ones who know how to connect the dots between what they've done and what companies actually need.

You probably think you need more certifications,
more years in the field, more ""traditional"" experience.
Â 
But right now, someone with your exact background is getting hired for the role you want.

What do they know that you don't?

They know that your ""unrelated"" experience isn't unrelated at allâ It's differentiated.
Â 
And in a sea of identical candidates, different wins.

Angus learned this lesson.
Â 
After months of applications going nowhere, one conversation with our team completely changed how he talked about his retail inventory experience.
Â 
Suddenly, procurement teams saw him as the candidate with real-world supply chain insights they couldn't get anywhere else.

That same reframe is waiting for you. Here's exactly how it worksð

WONSULTING WISDOM

Your Secret Advantage ð¤«

When Angus first came to us, he was doing what 95% of job seekers do.
Â 
Click ""Apply."" Cross fingers. Repeat.
Â 
He was an Inventory Manager in retail with an Economics degree, dreaming of breaking into procurement.Â 

On paper, he looked like every other career changer fighting an uphill battle.

But that's exactly where his advantage was hiding.

You see, while traditional candidates often sound identical to recruiters (""I'm passionate about your company because...""), Angus had something they didn't:Â 

A completely different perspective shaped by real-world challenges.

The same retail experience he thought was holding him back?Â 
It actually gave him supply chain insights that MBA graduates could only theorize about.Â 

The inventory management role he wanted to escape?Â 
It provided operational expertise that procurement teams desperately need.

The breakthrough came when Angus stopped apologizing for his background and started leveraging it.

Instead of writing cover letters that basically said ""Please overlook my retail experience,"" he began leading with confidence:Â 

""My hands-on experience managing inventory flows and vendor relationships gives me practical insights that translate directly to procurement optimization.""

Within two months, he wasn't just getting interviews.
He was getting offers ð

His new role as Procurement Analyst at Vida Design didn't happen despite his retail background. It happened because of it.

The lesson?
Â 
Your ""unconventional"" path isn't a bugâit's a feature.
The key is learning how to frame it correctly!

Â 
But here's the problem: When you're stuck inside your own story, it's nearly impossible to see your advantages clearly.

That's exactly why Angus was spinning his wheels for months before he talked with us.
Â 
And that's why we offer free career consultations where we help identify whatâs actually holding you back.

[SIGN-UP FOR FREE CONSULTATION â](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS)

There are 6 calls left this week.Â 
Â 
Will you take the first step towards landing your dream job?

LEVEL UP!

Exactly How to Reach Out to Recruiters

Here's the 4-sentence formula you can use today to transform cold outreach into warm conversations.
Â 
Each sentence has a specific psychological purpose.

Hereâs an outline that uses Angusâ target role:

Sentence 1 (Context): ""I noticed [Company] is expanding their procurement team based on the recent [specific job posting/news/LinkedIn update].""

Sentence 2 (Value Hook): ""My experience optimizing inventory flows and vendor relationships in retail has given me practical insights into supply chain efficiency that directly translate to procurement strategy.""

Sentence 3 (Credibility): ""I recently transitioned my approach to focus on data-driven procurement processes, which resulted in [specific example or relevant accomplishment].""

Sentence 4 (Ask): ""I'd love to learn more about your team's current priorities! Would you be open to a brief 15-minute conversation this week?""

Copy-paste skeleton:

- Sentence 1: Reference something specific about their company/role
- Sentence 2: Lead with your unique perspective as a strength
- Sentence 3: Provide concrete credibility
- Sentence 4: Make a small, specific ask

The magic isn't in the template.Â 

It's in the confidence shift it creates.Â 

When you stop positioning yourself as someone who needs a ""chance"" and start positioning yourself as someone who brings valuable perspective, everything changes.

Recruiters don't want to take risks on unknowns. But they absolutely want to hire people who can solve problems they haven't solved yet.

Your unconventional background just became your competitive advantage!

"Hi Muhammad,



At ZapConnect 2025, AI leaders could not stop talking about these trends:

 * AI is a connector, not just an app: The big wins come when AI plugs into 
the tools you already use (like email, CRM, and chat) so it can think while 
automation handles the busywork.
 * Now everyone can build with AI: Plain-English helpers and simple builders 
let non-technical teams create real workflows; hack days and demos spread 
skills fast.
 * Humans are still in charge: Approvals and activity logs maintain control 
and trust, while companies start managing âbot accountsâ the same way they 
manage people.
 * Real results beat experiments: Success stories show faster responses, 
better sales, and revenue gainsâbut pilot programs fail when AI sits off to the 
side instead of inside everyday processes.
 * Quick wins can fuel company systems: As AI helpers begin to outnumber 
people, teams must move from one-off automations to shared templates, dedicated 
tools (like lead routing), and training programs.
Check out these sessions for even more insights on scaling AI while they're 
still available on demand:

"Hi Muhammad,
Â 
Jerry here.Â 
Â 
When I was looking for a job, I knew I wanted to work at Google.

But I thought âEh Iâm not smart enough yet, so Iâm going to first work 2 years in consulting, get my MBA then get at job at Google.â

Impeccable 5 year plan right?
Â 
So my job search strategy?

Well â I didn't have a network and [NetworkAI](https://app.wonsulting.ai/networking-tool) didnât exist.
Â 
So I had to brute force my way in.
Â 
Anything with âstrategyâ âconsultingâ in the job title â I would apply because I had my resume tailored to strategy roles.
Â 
This was my week:
Â 

- 30 minutes after I woke up: Look through my schoolâs career portal, LinkedIn, Indeed etc. and apply to 5-10 jobs.
Â 

- 30 minutes during lunch: Look through the same search queries, apply to 5-10 jobs.
Â 

- 30 minutes before I slept: Same thing
Â 
By the end of 2 months, I applied to ~500 jobs and I realized I became numb to applying to jobs and seeing rejections.
Â 
Therefore I became shameless into applying to jobs.

Every morning, I was waking up to interviews and rejections.

And one day â I saw Google post an internship and the rest was history.

https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes

Â 
This is my challenge to you:
Â 
Define a target job title (eg marketing manager), [make a resume and make sure it has a 75+ resume score.](https://app.wonsulting.ai/?_gl=1*1kta3p*_gcl_au*MTc3NzU3NjgzMC4xNzM4NzcyOTAx*_ga*ODgzMTY4NTU2LjE3Mzg3NzI5MDI.*_ga_0ZGMQFR944*MTc0MzE5MDU2MC42Ni4xLjE3NDMxOTE2OTguNTAuMC43Njg0MDUzMTI.)
Â 
And start going for for the masses (marketing manager jobs).
Â 

https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes

Â 
You can find relevant jobs on JobBoardAI.

As a bonus, when you apply, the job board automatically tailors your resume and cover letter for you.

"Hi Muhammad,
Â 
Jerry here,
Â 
Your resume is like a highway billboard.
Â 
And recruiters are driving by at 90 mph ðð¨
Â 
You've got about 6 seconds to catch their attention.Â 
Â 
For some candidates, these 6 seconds lead to interviews...
Â 
For others, instant rejection.
Â 
But here's the thing most people don't know:
Â 
Recruiters don't usually ""read"" your resume - they SCAN it in an F-shaped pattern:

https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes

ð See that pattern?Â 
Â 
That's the path a recruiter's eyes follow when they first look at your resume.
Â 
And here's the problem:
Most resumes waste the ""hot zones"" with weak words and boring bullets.Â 
Â 
So here's your quick win in 3 steps:
Â 
1ï¸â£ Lead With Your BestÂ 

- Put your most relevant role and achievements first
- Align your first experiences with the job requirements

2ï¸â£ Front-Load Your Bullets

- Start with powerful action verbs that demand attention
- Put your impact at the beginning, not buried at the end
- Let ResumAI suggest high-impact starter words automatically
Â 

3ï¸â£ Stack Your Sections Strategically

- Order sections and experience by relevance to the target job
- Put your most impressive sections in the top third
- Create a natural flow that matches the F-pattern

Â 
When you align your content with the F-pattern, you're working WITH the recruiter's natural scanning habits,Â [â](https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes)not against them.Â 
Â 
Now picture this: Your resume, perfectly optimized to catch and hold attention.

No more instant rejections. No more being overlooked.

[ResumAI](https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes) makes your resume stand out:

âï¸ Instantly optimize your layout for maximum impact

âï¸ Generate attention-grabbing bullet points in seconds

âï¸ Transform boring duties into powerful achievements
Â 
Log into WonsultingAI and make your next 6 seconds with a recruiter count! ð

"Looking for a proven way to make your applications stand out?
Â 
We've got something interesting to share...
Â 
Most job seekers don't know this, but Harvard's world-class career resources are actually available to everyone - completely free.
Â 
Here's what most people miss:
Â 
Harvard has a comprehensive 22-page guide that breaks down exactly how to craft resumes and cover letters that get noticed.
Â 
Here's your action plan:

1/ Find the Guide ð

- [Click this link](https://cdn-careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/161/2024/08/2024-HES_resume-and-letter.pdf)
- Save it for reference (you'll want to come back to this!)Â 

Â 
2/ What You'll Get ð¡

- Professional resume templates
- High-impact word choices
- Cover letter frameworks
- Step-by-step formatting guidelines

Â 
3/ Why This Works â­

Your application materials are often your only chance to make a first impression.
Â 
Having access to Harvard's proven frameworks gives you an immediate advantage - especially when you're competing against hundreds of other applicants.

Pro Tip:
Â 
While the Harvard guide provides excellent frameworks, knowing if you've implemented them correctly is the real challenge.

That's where [ResumAI](https://app.wonsulting.ai/resumes) comes in.

No need to guess about your resume's effectiveness - ResumAI provides instant scoring across 14 key metrics that hiring managers look for ð

AI Red Teaming Roadmap

Together with Learn Prompting

Weâve partnered with the Learn Prompting teamâthe creators of the world's first Prompt Engineering course (launched two months before ChatGPT)âto bring you the new AI Red Teaming Roadmap (https://updates.roadmap.sh/e3t/Ctc/L2+113/d5qLSh04/MXgT8jhz1yfN5K_t4mV_ZShW4KxtYX5wGFjcN6wcHql3gP0xW6N1vHY6lZ3pyW59W-vj8PkwJkW8ksHrN6fb7n5W6fhncK2vD5dpW4lPkbz2z3_vYW5Sd0xR3P6y-yW2L69Ct42kMmgW2-Ftpt2wBqHFW4t-tf_3pjPr5W456wW83NjfwHW1BXX5q7ZRyBTW67hFTG7YNrwWW7w5CHQ3bTnZ7W3tFnRY6gGw0QW10vCq_1r2y7mW8mxYWB4s4Xc9N3jpHBHVYHdjN4_5jxtBvWPgW6vKYmP4KWClCW8YCJqd7VLBJ-W73mGlD1XmBD6W6V4xb_4YKq6hW3BFP_P2X_19yf8KFClH04 ) . Their team believes AI Red Teaming is the next major career in Generative AI.

If youâre new to AI Red Teaming: it involves systematically testing AI models by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. This critical role ensures AI systems remain safe, ethical, and secure.

No coding or technical skills required. Some of the best AI Red Teamers come from diverse backgrounds like psychology, acting, biology, and neuroscience. All you need is curiosity, creativity, and an interest pushing the boundaries of AI systems.

Announcing HackAPrompt 2.0, $100K AI Red Teaming Competition

Together with Learn Prompting

Last year, the Learn Prompting team partnered with OpenAI and Hugging Face to launch the first-ever AI Red Teaming competition, HackAPrompt. Over 3,300 people competed, with winnersâincluding some with no prior AI experienceâgoing on to become professional AI Red Teamers at top labs like Anthropic.

Now, HackAPrompt 2.0 is back on May 16th, in partnership with the leading global AI companies. This is your chance to learn AI Red Teaming (https://updates.roadmap.sh/e3t/Ctc/L2+113/d5qLSh04/MXgT8jhz1yfN5K_t4mV_ZShW4KxtYX5wGFjcN6wcHql3gP0xW6N1vHY6lZ3p0W4h374J2PzMDyW58lsGL2x6j6ZVf1GlX9crBsrW2whlr07j8p7CW3BDy5h1LzCzVN6Q4xMtwtVbhW2G-7c23shFctVkV0R_7b9fTGW6rk9sF7thF4WW5vy3Fv7Y__H4W88XMjC95SJlmW5lmpkZ6DR6_nW42JSQY3J-8kYW2NPHdx8BbBPpW4zBRc74pqh9CW3zC7JV6BXpjrW8-7dFW3CfDVMW6BLJm349DssnW2Pd0T08xFhK9W7Nz3jg75K60cW3DM1nn5Y_7ynVS1cX979tlYqf5FbVHx04 ) from their easy to use tutorials, compete to attack real-world AI systems, win prizes from a $100,000 prize pool, and potentially land your next career opportunity.

No experience? No problemâLast yearâs winner, Valen Tagliabue, started without any AI or security backgroundâtoday, he's professionally red teaming AI models at Anthropic.

"WONSULTING WEEKLY NEWSLETTER

Â 
It worked.
Â 
This exact resume landed interviews at JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Dellð
Â 
Access interview landing resumes here:
[wonsulting.ai/community](https://app.wonsulting.ai/community)

â

https://app.wonsulting.ai/community?resume=0206fe79-0862-4c4e-991d-70caa3bd6412

Â 
But there's somethingÂ unusual about this resume that most job seekers completely miss.

It's not the Northeastern degree.
Not even the Meta internship.

It's something much more powerful.
Â 
Look closer at this resume:

- ""Enhanced UI with ReactJS... resulting in 36% more accuracy.""
- ""Analyzed 50+ companies... generating 12% returns through 3 successful trades.""
- ""Achieved 92% accuracy in error calculation.""
Every bullet point contains a specific, measurable achievement.
Â 
Recruiters don't just want to know what you did.
They want to know the measurable impact you created.
Â 
But here's what makes this even more powerful...
Â 
Shirin had solid data science skills but watched less qualified candidates get her interviews.

Her resume was getting lost. She couldn't figure out why.

Then she used ResumAI to transform her experiences into quantified bullet points using this exact formula.

""ResumAI helped me create a resume that was clean, quantifiable, and tailored to the data analyst roles I was applying to,"" Shirin shared.

The result? She landed a full-time position as Supply Chain Diversity Data Analyst at Vistra Corp. Her manager even praised the resume she submitted.

You might be thinking, ""But I don't have impressive achievements to quantify.""

Here's what most people miss: every job has measurable impact.
Â 
ResumAI helps you find and articulate your impact using the same proven formula that worked for JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Dell.

The same approach that got interviews at these top companies also transformed Shirin's entire job search.
Â 
And this same formula is built into ResumAI.

So stop being the talented professional who gets ignored.
Start being the one recruiters call first!

How To Get Hired When
1,700 People Apply in 15 Hours

The job market is flooded ð§ï¸ð£

AI mass-application tools lowered the bar,Â so many applicants started applying to everything.

Itâs just too easy.
Â 
Candidates can fire off 100+ applications an hour.
But their generic applications donât get noticed.

And they make it harder for truly good candidates to get seen.
Â 
Last month, a Y Combinator startup posted 8 roles.Â 
23,000 applications arrived in 30 days.Â¹

That's 2,875 people fighting for one position.â

Spotify opened a single NYC engineering role.Â 
1,700 applications in 15 hours.â

You might think hiring managers
Would be excited about so many candidates.

But they're not. They're drowning.â

Here's what nobody's telling you:Â 
It's harder than ever for hiring managers to find qualified candidates

Recruiters at major tech companies report that only 10% of their hires now come from inbound applications.Â¹
Â 
The majority come from direct outreach and referrals.â

But here's the question that stops most people:
How do you find hiring managers?Â 
And how do you reach them without seeming desperate?

This is where everything changes.Â 

Because there's something that solves both problems at once ð

â

[Shadow]

The Application Avalanche
(And What Hiring Managers Did About It)

[NetworkAI's Cold Email](https://app.wonsulting.ai/networking-tool)Â feature finds the exact email addresses of hiring managers at companies you want to work for.Â 
Â 
Not LinkedIn messages that vanish.Â 
Not applications that die in an ATS.Â 
Direct email addresses.Â 

This lets you skip the 2,875-person line entirely.

But most people waste this advantage by asking for jobs.Â 
Â 
Here's what actually gets responses:
Never ask for a job.
Â 
Instead, find companies that are hiring, identify the likely hiring manager on LinkedIn, and use [NetworkAI's Cold Email](https://app.wonsulting.ai/networking-tool) to find their email address.Â 

Then send them a message like thisð",not_job

We've added powerful new ways for you to learn through chat, updated several roadmaps, and started work on some exciting new features. Let's get into it.

Floating Chat on Roadmaps

You'll now see a floating chat widget on all roadmap pages. Think of it as your personal guide while learning. You can ask it anything about the roadmap, dive deeper into any topic, get recommendations for what to learn next, or even ask it to test your knowledge.

It can also create a personalized roadmap for you, keep track of your progress, suggest project ideas, and more, all without leaving the page.

Dedicated Roadmap Chat Page

Want a more focused experience? There's now a dedicated roadmap chat page where you can do everything mentioned above in a larger, cleaner interface. This is great if you just want to learn through conversation or dive deeper into a specific area.

Global Chat Assistant

We've also launched a global chat assistant that knows about the content on roadmap.sh, understands which roadmaps you're following, and keeps track of your progress. It can help you discover new roadmaps, give career advice, recommend courses, and offer personalized learning suggestions based on your goals.

You can even upload your resume to get tailored feedback, which will not only improve the quality of the responses but also provide tips on improving your resume and job search.

"Dear all,

Ever find yourself stuck between the safer route of *ÙÙÚ©Ø±Û (Naukari)* and
the thrilling uncertainty of *Ú©Ø§Ø±ÙØ¨Ø§Ø± (Karobaar)*? You're not alone,  it's
a dilemma most of us face at some point.

To help you *decipher this very choice*, the *FAST Entrepreneurship Society

*""Naukari vs Karobaar""*

ð *9th May (Friday)*
ð *9:30 AM â 11:00 AM*

Weâve invited *three powerhouse speakers* from diverse backgrounds whoâve
seen both sides of the coin:

ð¹ *Mehboob Shar* â Featured by Google, heâs one of Pakistanâs top SEO
experts. His career is a testament to how personal branding and digital
strategy can open global doors, a name in demand.

ð¹ *Ammar Jamshed* is the coâfounder of Coursemon, a data scientist, a
speaker, and an author of *Incoherences*. Ammar has trained hundreds in
Data & AI â proof that knowledge can be monetized through both jobs *and*
 ventures.

ð¹ *Yasir Nawaz* â A multi-talented force in data analytics, digital
marketing, and advertising. Currently at Securiti, he balances corporate
experience with entrepreneurial energy.

This session will explore:
âï¸ The pros and cons of *ÙÙÚ©Ø±Û (Naukari / Job)* vs *Ú©Ø§Ø±ÙØ¨Ø§Ø± (Karobaar /
Business)*
âï¸ How to know what path suits *you*
âï¸ Real talk â expectations vs reality in both careers

Come with questions, leave with clarity.

Dear Students,
I need to compile a list of your project groups based on your group  
members' IDs and project titles. Since this GCR includes both Sections A  
and B, and some of you did not specify your section in the proposal,  
organizing the projects has become a bit challenging.

Below is an Excel file with two separate sheets: one for Section A and one  
for Section B. Please carefully enter your group membersâ IDs and your  
project title in the sheet corresponding to your section. Do not mix  
entries between the two sheets. Thanks!

2025-Spring CL3001 Computer Networks Lab BCS-6D  

New announcement

Dear Students,

Lab and midterm marks have been uploaded. I noticed a few issues with some  
of the submitted files â some files could not be opened. Therefore, if you  
see a zero (0) in your marks, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

    - The question was attempted incorrectly or completely wrong.
    - The submitted file could not be opened.

If you just want to know the reason behind your marks, you may visit my  
office on Tuesday between 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

If you wish to review your paper, you must bring your laptop to the  
university.

Note: No queries related to lab and midterm will be entertained via email.

Thank you.
See details

"*EXAMINATION RULES*




*1.*  FAST - National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences has a
zero-tolerance policy regarding the use of unfair means. Mobile phones and
smart watches are strictly not allowed in the examination hall.  If mobile
phones or smart watches are brought in the examination hall, then they
should be put in the book bag and the bag be kept at the front of
the examination hall.  If the student is caught in possession of a mobile
phone or a smartwatch during the examination, it would be considered as use
of unfair means, irrespective of whether the mobile phone is on or off, a
smartphone or a feature phone.



*2.*  Students can only bring a transparent pouch/ pencil box to the seat
of examination.



*3.*  Non-programmable, non-graphing calculators are allowed in
the examination hall for relevant courses only unless prohibited by the
course instructor.



*4.*  Students are required to sit according to the seating plan. The
invigilator can reallocate any student from their designated seat.



*5.*  Students are required to search for the examination seat and the
surrounding area prior to taking a seat.  If they find any paper or some
writing on the seat/desk, they must report it to the invigilator
immediately.  If caught during the exam, they will be deemed responsible
for it.



*6.*  Students are not allowed to raise their voices during the exam.  In
case of any need, they will raise their hands to call the attention of the

*9.* Students are not allowed to continue writing after the
examiner/invigilator announces, âThe time is over, put your pens downâ.



*10.*  Students may wish to pace themselves with their own watches, but the
invigilator will be the official timekeeper of the examination.



*11.*  Examination days will be considered normal routine days and hence
the dress code should be strictly followed during the exams. Students
violating the dress code will not be allowed to sit in the exams. No
re-take applications will be entertained in such cases.

"*PLAN AHEAD : DAAD Germany: SERI Switzerland Fully Funded Scholarships
2026**Prepare
Now & Apply**Early Notice*

*Just one Important thing. I personally know and met the new head of the
DAAD program whom details are given below. This year there will be huge
number seats for full PhD and also for PhD exchange under DAAD. As they
already have done meetings regarding it. I know this fact and sharing with
you. So apply this year in Germany with full confidence for PhD and PhD
exchange. I have not written this note on LinkedIn as he is added with me
on LinkedIn (So when you copy this post, remove this paragraph while
posting)*

Dear all,
This year, Germany and Switzerland Governments â through Scholarships,
DAAD, and SERI â will open opportunities for PhD, Post Docs, and Research
positions. They will have deadlines in August and September. So, while you
are starting your last semester or already finishing (or finished) your
last semester, why not search for professors and secure a position using
the government funding which is your right provided by these governments
*Main purpose:*
Encouraging eligible candidates to *start finding & contacting professors
now, preparing research proposals, and meeting application requirements
(especially IELTS)* early, well before applications open in *AugustâSeptember
2025*.
*SECTION I â FOR GERMANY for 2026 Session**PhD, Post Doctorate, Research
Exchange Fully Funded Scholarships by DAAD Germany & Germany Embassy in
Pakistan*

*(You can search your country's Germany Embassy/DAAD website according to
your passport country, as they can vary)*

*ADVANCED NOTICE: Work on it now*
Dear all, the German Embassy at Islamabad & DAAD will offer Fully Funded
Scholarships for PhD, Research Assistant, or Exchange (for MPhil/Master
Degree holders, PhD Students, Post Doctorate) in the following *three types
of programs *for 2026 (Read Full Post):

   1. *PhD in Germany*
   2. *03 to 06 Months Short Term Research Visits for Master Degree
   Holders, current PhD Students in Pakistan, and Post Doctoral Seekers to
   German Universities*
   3. *One Year Long Term Duration Research Visits for Master Degree
   Holders and current PhD Students in Pakistan to German Universities*

People from all majors can apply for these programs provided that the
majors are offered in German Universities. These three kinds of programs
are funded by DAAD & the German Embassy in Pakistan.

*Deadline: (Not announced yet, will likely be around 30 August 2025)*

*Important Requirement:*
*One of the most important requirements,* along with others, is that you
need a German professor who is ready to supervise you under any one of the
three modalities, along with a research proposal developed under the
proposed German supervisor.

*Additional Requirement:*
It is compulsory to have IELTS with a minimum band score of 6.5. Prepare
and fulfill all other requirements (see websites below) and apply for this
opportunity
*SECTION II â FOR SWITZERLAND 2026-2027 Session*PhD, Post Doc, & Research
Exchange Scholarships in Switzerland (Pakistani Quota by Swiss Govt.)


*Instructions:*

   - Search on the SERI website using your country name/passport country
   and follow the details accordingly.
   - *If you want to apply, start preparing today.*

*Advanced Notice for Switzerland:*
Upcoming Switzerland PhD, Post Doc, Research Exchange, and Medical
Scholarships 2026-2027 by the Swiss Government for Pakistan â Advanced
Notice. Work on it now for every Field/Major.

*Details:*

   - Every year, Pakistan does not get its fair share of PhD, Post
   Doctorate, and Research Exchange (in any major/field, including Medical)
   Scholarships at Swiss Institutes offered by the Swiss Government under the
   SERI Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Scholars and
   Artists.
   - The key requirement is the acceptance letter from a Swiss professor at
   a designated Swiss University for PhD, Post Doc, or Research Exchange (for
   candidates with 18 years of education), and for Pakistani medical doctors
   at certain Swiss Medical Hospitals, along with a strong profile.

*Experience from Previous Years:*

   - Most times, professors have already accepted another student from
   another country because you might be late in emailing and impressing them,
   or you do not spend enough time understanding the professorâs profile and
   relating your work to it.
   - Do not send low-quality, copied emails to Swiss professors as you
   might to Chinese professors. Bombarding Swiss professors with low-quality
   emails or emails that only list your qualifications may not only lead to
   rejection but also create a bad impression of Pakistani students.

*Additional Details for Switzerland:*

   - *Deadlines for the 2026-27 intake will be around the end of September
   2025*, with the applications opening in August 2025.
   - What you need to do now:


   1.
      1. Check the requirements from the previous year and fulfill them for
      this year 2026 (English IELTS/TOEFL scores, etc. are a must).
      2. Contact professors immediately. Even if they say their labs are
      full, ask if they can accept you in July or August 2026, so that you can
      apply earlier than others.
      3. Prepare and upgrade your profile, relating it effectively to the
      Swiss professorâs work, as Swiss professors are very particular about
      quality and relevance.

Deep Learning for Perception Spring 2025  

New announcement

Dear Students

I have posted updated notes for Word Embeddings. An updated figure has also  
been included. A clarification from the class lecture:
a) For featurized embeddings learning, One-hot encoding (of the desired  
word) is considered and this is used for backtracking and learning.
b) It is important to understand the relationship between E, e, W, and O.   
You should review the lecture notes  for clarity.

Teamwork is a few clicks away
 
It's easier than you think to get started


One of the best ways to jump in quickly and get visibility in your team's project is to claim tasks that haven't been assigned yet. All it takes is 3 easy steps:
 
1. Filter your Jira project to Unassigned
 
2. Add missing details to task descriptions
 
3. Tag yourself or a teammate as the assignee

"Hi Muhammad,
Â 
Jerry here,
Thanks for signing up for WonsultingAI.
Â 
As a thank you, Iâm sharing my roadmap to help you land your dream job.
Â 
These are the same tactics I used to land my last job at Google, and the same advice we give all our clients at Wonsulting.
Â 
First, focus on 1 job title youâre qualified for. Remember recruiters hire specialists, not generalists.Â 
Â 
In this job market, I recommend minimizing switching job titles, given the competitive landscape.Â 
Â 
Â 
[DAYS 2-3] Optimize Your Resume
Â 
Upload your resume to [ResumAI by Wonsulting](http://app.wonsulting.ai) and find your resume score.
Â 
Your goal is to get at least 75.
Â 
Implement the recommended fixes.
Â 
http://app.wonsulting.ai
Â 
[DAYS 4-10] Apply to Jobs
Â 
Once your resume is at least a 75, start applying to at least 50 jobs with that job title from step 1.
Â 
This is the most important part: Do not deviate job titles with that resume.
Â 
This resume should be tailored to that job title.Â 
Â 
[Use JobBoardAI to tailor your resume and cover letter to every job with 1 click:](http://app.wonsulting.ai)Â 
Â 
http://app.wonsulting.ai
Â 
We are going to use those 50 jobs as data points to see how effective your resume is when applying to jobs.
Â 
Wait until at least 2 weeks to see how effective your resume is.Â 
Â 
If you get at least 2 interviews, then your resume is good enough and doesnât require any more changes.Â 
Â 
However, you need to keep applying!
Â 
If you donât get interviews? You probably need to change your resume or target job title.Â 
Â 
Â 
[DAYS 4-10] Networking
Â 
I think of networking & applying like two sides of the same coin.
Â 
You find that one job you're actually excited about. You hit ""apply,"" hoping for the best.
Â 
But here's the reality:
Â 
You have maybe a ~2% chance of landing an interview.Â 
Â 
That's it. Makes you wish you could do more, right?
Â 
That's where networking comes in â LinkedIn, cold emails to hiring managers, the works. Itâs about increasing those odds.
Â 
Both are necessary, but it does depend on your industry.
Â 
Some hiring managers prefer a well-crafted cold email to a LinkedIn message.
Â 
Now, you might be thinking, âOK, Jerry... but how do I find those hiring managers?â
Â 
Glad you asked.
Â 
[NetworkAI has you covered, it makes it easy to do both.](http://app.wonsulting.ai)
Â 
ð
Â

NetworkAI Cold Emailing
Â 
Â 
https://app.wonsulting.ai/networking-tool
Â 
Are you ready to crush your job search this month?
Â 
Use this as your roadmap, and remember, I'm rooting for you.
Â 
To start:
Log into WonsultingAI, start updating your resume, and remember to hit that 75% resume score mark.

New announcement

Hey Champs!

I have reviewed your recent submissions and would like to address some  
concerns regarding the overall performance.
Those of you who have received 8 or 9 marks, it is due to incomplete work,  
plagiarism, or errors in your code. It's essential to submit work that  
reflects your own understanding and effort. As you know, academic integrity  
is a key component of learning, and I urge you to take ownership of your  
work moving forward.

Additionally, it's clear that many of you copied the answer for the last  
question, as it was evident that you did not even attempt to understand the  
question properly. The task required a 3x3 grid, not a 9x9 grid, yet many  
of you went ahead and used the latter.

This time, I have not deducted many marks, but please be aware that if this  
happens again, I will be forced to give a straight 0 for the assignment.

If you are struggling with any part of the assignment or have questions,  
please feel free to come to my office and ask for assistance rather than  
resorting to plagiarism. I am here to help you succeed and would prefer to  
guide you through any difficulties you're facing.

"Dear Fakhira,

The seats will be open soon in all the available electives. Do not worry,
you will be informed soon.",not_job
"Dear Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing on behalf of students who
were unable to register for their electives during the registration period.
Unfortunately, due to the server being down at the time, we could not
enroll, and by the time the system became accessible again, the elective
seats had already been filled.

The first week of classes is already about to end, and we are left without
an elective, which has left us in a very difficult position. We kindly
request your urgent assistance in resolving this matter, either by
increasing the seat capacity in the electives or allowing us to register
manually.
We would greatly appreciate your support, as this situation is beyond our
control, and we do not want to fall behind in our coursework.

Thank you for your time and understanding. We look forward to your guidance
on how to proceed.

Sincerely,
Syeda Fakhira Saghir

"*Teach For Pakistan* is dedicated to addressing educational inequity by
cultivating a network of leaders through its highly selective Fellowship
Program . This *full-time,
paid initiative* recruits top graduates from Pakistanâs leading
universities, such as *FAST University*, and provides them with a rigorous
Leadership Development program. Fellows work at the grassroots level to
drive meaningful educational reform while gaining the skills and context
needed to create long-term systemic change. The program envisions a future
where these leaders, equipped with their experiences, will hold influential
positions and make decisions that shape the nationâs progress. Alumni
 of the Fellowship have gone
on to achieve remarkable success, including prestigious scholarships like
*Fulbright*, admission to top graduate schools such as *Harvard*, and
impactful roles in organizations like *UNDP*, where they continue to tackle
educational inequity.

As part of the global Teach For All  network,
*Teach For Pakistan* has already made significant strides, with *150
Fellows* currently placed in government schools across Karachi and
Islamabad, and *302 Alumni* impacting over *26,000 children in 92 schools*.
The organization is now recruiting for its *2025 Fellowship*, with the
application deadline set for *March 16th*. To engage potential candidates,
an Information Session is proposed at FAST University, targeting *final-year
students* from all disciplines. This session will outline the Fellowship
application process, provide an opportunity to interact with the Lead
Recruiter, and inspire students to join a movement that ensures every child
in Pakistan receives a quality education, fostering thoughtful and
compassionate future citizens.

"*Teach For Pakistan* is dedicated to addressing educational inequity by
cultivating a network of leaders through its highly selective Fellowship
Program . This *full-time,
paid initiative* recruits top graduates from Pakistanâs leading

where these leaders, equipped with their experiences, will hold influential
positions and make decisions that shape the nationâs progress. Alumni
 of the Fellowship have gone
on to achieve remarkable success, including prestigious scholarships like
*Fulbright*, admission to top graduate schools such as *Harvard*, and
impactful roles in organizations like *UNDP*, where they continue to tackle
educational inequity.

As part of the global Teach For All  network, *Teach
For Pakistan* has already made significant strides, with *150 Fellows*
currently placed in government schools across Karachi and Islamabad, and *302
Alumni* impacting over *26,000 children in 92 schools*. The organization is

Hi -Â it's Nick Singh from DataLemur / Ace the DS Interview here to air out my dirty laundry:

**Â  My girlfriend hates me because I tell her she's NOTÂ special **

She's a full-time Data Analyst who's simultaneously searching for a new job, and she'llÂ complain to me about problems like:

**""I applied to 30 jobs but only got 1 interview""

""This open job has senior analyst expectations, butÂ junior analyst pay""

""I can't find time to study for interviews dueÂ to my hectic schedule""**

I constantly remind her she's not special, everyone has these issues,Â and she HATES hearing that.

(yes, I get it, she's looking for sympathy, wants to feelÂ heard, etc.)Â 

But that's not going to stop me from ranting about:

* why the ""â¨I'm specialâ¨"" mindset isÂ detrimental

* why thinking your NOT being special is a GOOD thing for tech careersÂ 

* 5 amazing career advice resources from different leaders in tech that'llÂ helpÂ 98.9% of people (regardless of their uniqueÂ backgrounds)

****Special Snowflake SyndromeÂ âï¸****

Growing up inÂ 90s America, IÂ had motivational posters like this one in most of my classrooms:

My teachers taught me that there were different ""learning styles""... and that we all learn uniquely.Â 

They told me that Kyle, my middle-school bully, isn't dumbÂ because he's in 8th grade and can't read and write... he's just a musical auditory learner who's actually a genius because he can play the guitar.Â 

Fast forward to 2023, and psychologists have debunked all this ""my brain learns differently"" nonsense, and my bully /Â auditory genius classmate Kyle works the Taco Bell drive thru.

We're not all special snowflakes, who learn in our own unique ways.

We're not all special snowflakes, with unique personalities & interests.Â 

(swipe on Tinder for 2 minutes to see how ""unique"" your passion for dogs / the office / tacos / pizza / traveling are)

Similarly, you're not a special snowflake with totally unique career challenges!

I know this from having done hundreds of 1:1 career coaching sessions https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJt5X6mmNE~j-s008QGWqUP6XF5ytPL with people from a variety of backgrounds, ages, and countries - it all boils down to the same struggles:

* How do I find a careerÂ that I'll love

* How do I build the specific skills needed forÂ my dream career

* How do I convince others to give me that interview / job / promotion

****You're Not Special and that's GOOD****
Knowing you're not facing special problems is an EMPOWERING mindset to have when you're grinding on the job hunt or trying to climb the career Â Ì¶lÌ¶aÌ¶dÌ¶dÌ¶eÌ¶rÌ¶ jungle gym https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJt5X6mmNE~j-s108QGWqUP6XF5ytPL.Â 

Realizing your career struggles aren'tÂ special means:

* you're more open to learning from other's experiences and wisdom, rather than discounting their advice because their journey doesn't exactly match up to your own

* you're less likely to have unrealistic expectations for learning & career growth, which will save you a ton of frustration and make you more patient

* you'll be more receptive to hearing how others faced similar challenges and overcame them, which will provide you comfort and help you be resilient during difficult times

****

****Career Advice I LoveÂ â¤ï¸****So, now that you hopefully realize that your career struggles might not be so unique, here's some general career advice from different tech leaders that you NEED to read:

Hi - if you want a kick-ass career in tech, you need to think about your career 

**non-linearly**.

Before I share stories of Data Scientists and Software Engineers at 

**Airbnb** & 

**Spotify**Â who followed non-linear career paths, let's analyze Sheryl Sandberg's 

**weird** journey to FacebookÂ 

**COO.Â **

In 2000, Sheryl worked as Chief of Staff to Larry Summers at the US Treasury Department - a job which had nothing to do with tech/advertising/sales.

However, In 2001, Google CEO Eric Schmidt was impressed by her intellect, so tried to recruit her.

Sheryl for the longest time was reluctant to join this small startupÂ because it looked like a step DOWN for her.

In hindsight, she's glad she made the leap: she crushed the Google job, became VP of Ads, and grew her org from 4 to 4,000 employees in six short years .Â 

Then, Zuck poached her to become COO at Facebook, which is how she got her net-worth of $1.8 billion.

It's wild to think that her switch into tech almost didn't happen because of her preconceived notions about climbing a traditional career ladder.

That's why she now preaches about the career jungle gym:

The path forward in your career might not be straight ahead; we need to be open to a sideways move, maybe even a step back, to ultimately realize our full potential.Â 

This is known as swinging in the career jungle gym, or following the career lattice (rather than climbing the corporate ladder).Â 

****

****Non-Linear Path AdvantagesÂ ****Non-linear career paths, while circuitous and stressful, have two big advantages:Â Â 

**#1 - Non-Linearity BuildsÂ ResilienceÂ **

Non-linear paths force you to get comfortable with uncertainty and adapting to new work challenges, and overall become mentally tougher.

Simply put, if you take control and f*** up your own career journey with twists and turns, you'll be a lot less scared of layoffs or getting fired because you've dealt with big career changes already.Â 

**#2Â - Non-LinearityÂ Builds CEOÂ SkillsÂ **

A non-linear path helps you build theÂ broadÂ range of experiences and skills needed to be a CEO or entrepreneur; something that'll never happen working inÂ one narrow discipline.Â 

This diverse skill set helps you open up new, unexpected paths into the C-suite.

****Non-Linear Paths to Airbnb & Spotify****
To inspire you, here's some examples of people who've had kick-ass, non-linear careers in tech:

**â ï¸ Hasseeb Qureshi: Poker to Airbnb** https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-oz08QGWqUP6XF5ytPL

Hasseeb was a top-ranked high stakes professional poker player, then Director of Product at a Startup. After PM, he went to a SWE bootcamp, and ended up working at Coinbase & Airbnb. Now he's managing partner / VC at Dragonfly (a crypto fund).

**ââï¸ Mikiko Bazeley: Hair Salon to MLOps** https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-o008QGWqUP6XF5ytPL

Miki graduated with a 2.3 GPA and worked as a stylist at a hair salon out of college. Then, she joined a startup as a ""Sales Hacker"". From there, she did BizOps, and then transitioned into Data Science at Autodesk & Teladoc. Learning more SWE, she did MLOps at Intuit, and is now Head of MLOps at FeatureForm.Â 

ï¸ââï¸ https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-o108QGWqUP6XF5ytPL**Sydney Bang: Exercise Science to Spotify** https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-o108QGWqUP6XF5ytPL

Sydney went from a degree inÂ Kinesiology to Analytics Engineer at Spotifyin just 2 years, by way of working Customer Success at a startup, then being a Data Analyst at Kickstarter.

Â 

****My Non-Linear CareerÂ ****
I can personally attest to the power of non-linear careers, because I'm lucky enough to have one - but it wasn't always this way!

Starting out my career at Facebook, I had a linear view of careers, and at age 22 I fully expected to just do technical roles at FAANG and collect increasingly bigger paychecks till I chose to retire.Â 

A year into Facebook, after I was sorta burnt out from the job, I decided to YOLO and embrace non-linearity.

I took a BIG pay-cut to join geospatial analytics startup SafeGraph, whereÂ I got to do a variety of work across data, marketing, and developer evangelism, and even got to the represent the company on CNN, NPR, and Fox News.Â 

This breadth of work at SafeGraph, combined with my more traditional experience at Facebook, gave me the idea to post tech career advice onÂ LinkedIn https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-o208QGWqUP6XF5ytPLÂ back in 2019.

Getting positive feedback on my career tips from my LI followers nudged me to write my best-selling book Ace the Data Science Interview https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-oy08QGWqUP6XF5ytPL, which then turned intoÂ DataLemur.com https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-o308QGWqUP6XF5ytPLÂ (a free way to practice for SQL & Python & Data Science interviews).

At 22, I never dreamed of being a full-time author and entrepreneur, but I guess that's the magic of embracing a non-linear career!Â â¨

Till next time,Â 

**Nick Singh**

p.s. If you're trying to get a new job in data science / ML / analytics, you NEED to watch my video course ""Ace the Data Job Hunt https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-o408QGWqUP6XF5ytPL"".

It's got 25 videos on resumes, portfolio projects, behavioral interviews, and cold email networking, packed with unique tactics you've probably never heard aboutÂ 

**because I'm not a traditional career coach**.

p.p.s. If you need personalized tips on making your way through the career jungle gym, or simply want your resume & LinkedIn critiqued & improved, I offer 1:1 career coaching https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJs5X6jmNE~j-o408QGWqUP6XF5ytPL as well (and you get access to the video course for free this way!)

Hi - Nick Singh here from DataLemur/Ace the Data ScienceÂ Interview here to warn you about the mid-twit mental trap and how it's hurting your tech career.

It's related to those mid-twit IQ-bell curve memes... you've seen theseÂ before, right?Â 

IQ bell curve memes make fun of a commonplace phenomena:

**Â  Mid-IQs (mid-twits) complicate things.
Â  Dumb & Smart people keep shit simple.Â **

By the end of this email, you will:

* Realize the tech career advice you've internalized is likely for mid-twits

* Understand why influencers are incentivized to overcomplicate things

* Become more confident about advancing in your career (because things are actually simple, and the bar is stupidly low)

First, let's cover how we got into this mid-twit mess.

****Why Gurus Lead Us Into Mid-Twittery ****
Overly complicated mid-twit advice abounds not because it's correct or helpful.

It's because thought leaders have perverse incentives to lead us into mid-twittery.Â 

Gurus can't stand out on social media if they give generic, simple advice.

To compete, they differentiate themselves by complicating things in the hopes of capturing your attention.Â 

Similarly, influencers find it hard to monetize simplistic advice, because consumers don't pay for advice that'll fit on a single page.

That's why authors convolute basic concepts and write fluff in order to sell you a 200-page book.

This phenomenon is most obvious in the health & fitness world, where it's difficult to monetize the one-liner ""

**eat less, exercise more**"".

That's why every few years you'll see another contrived fad diet:

Simply put, for influencers it pays $ to dispense over-complicated advice to mid-twits.Â 

I know what you're probably thinking at this point...

Â 

****Nick you're a guru... and a hypocrite?!****
As someone with 155kÂ LinkedIn https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-kw08QGWqUP6XF5ytPL followers, 25k on Twitter https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-kx08QGWqUP6XF5ytPL, and a best-selling book on Data Science Interviews https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-ky08QGWqUP6XF5ytPL, you might think it's a bit hypocritical for me to call out tech influencers and career gurus since I sorta am one!

But I'd like to think my brand was built on dispensing simple, concrete, and mostly FREE advice like: * Go build portfolio projects https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-kz08QGWqUP6XF5ytPL

* Show off projects to hiring managers by sending cold emails https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-k008QGWqUP6XF5ytPL

* Go learn SQL by practicing real SQL interview questions https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-k108QGWqUP6XF5ytPL

Of course, if you think I'm guilty of dispensing overly-complicated advice, reply and let me know - I'm always looking for feedback on ways to make my tips simpler!Â 

Anyways, back to the main point for today: the bar is stupidly low, and honestly you don't need to follow overly complex advice to get ahead in your tech career.

****The Bar Is Shockingly Low****
Recently, I spoke at the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) where I covered How to Ace the Data Job Hunt https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-k208QGWqUP6XF5ytPL for a crowd of 120 people.Â 

During the talk, something shocking happened, which made me realize just how low the bar was for job hunting.

I asked the audience:

Â  Â Â ""On your resume, how 

**published**
Â  Â  Â is your portfolio project""?

2 people out of 120 had a proper URL to their project (ex. DataLemur.com)

5 people had a link to a repo (ex. github .com/NickSingh/DataLemur)

Surprised by how few people had resumes which linked to their project, I asked the 120 people a more basic question:

**Â  Â Â ""Forget links. Who has a non-school,
Â  Â  Â individually done portfolio project
Â  Â  Â on your resume?""**

**Only 10ish more hands went up!Â **

Here I was, droning on and on about how to make a good portfolio project even more amazing by buying a domain name for it (ex. ""BobReccomendsMovies.com"").

Yet, 85% of the room didn't even have a single individually & independently finished project to their name!

Â 

This experience made me feel so dumb for giving advanced advice when most of the audience hadn't done the portfolio project basics!

Low Bar: Facebook Referrals
Another story of how low the bar is comes from 2018 when I judged a hackathon at the University of Virginia (my alma mater) on behalf of my employer, 

**Facebook**.

Over the course of the weekend, I gave 12 people my official @facebook.com email address since they asked for a referral.Â 

**ZERO** of them sent me an email asking for a referral within the next year!

I'm not even sure why I bother teaching people about 6 cold email rules to never break https://nicksingh79965.acemlna.com/lt.php?x=3TZy~GE6KaKfEHz-_Q1GUuRzAX-pvN-gkuovY5jMIFia5XKryEy.yuJr5X6imNE~j-k308QGWqUP6XF5ytPL when the majority of people won't even follow-up with someone they met IRL.Â 

Instead of recounting 894 more stories of how doing the basic stuff can get you ahead in your career, I'll leave you with an apt quote:
Â 

**Â Â ""Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."" - Confucius**

Till next time,
